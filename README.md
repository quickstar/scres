## Overview

scres is just a simple console application to edit the Variables.txt from Starcraft II. Since I'm using different monitors I need to change the resolution all the time.
The tool gets the height of your current resolution, updates the according config entry and launches the "starcraft II.exe". 

## Requirements

Obviously Starcraft II is needed.

## Installation

Just build in release mode, add the executable to your desired path e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\scres and make sure you add this path to the PATH environment variable.
Then open a cmd prompt and execute scres.
