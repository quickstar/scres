## Overview

scres is just a simple console application to edit the Variables.txt from Starcraft II. Since I'm using different monitors I need to change the resolution all the time.
if the current hight is set to 1200 it changes it to 1080 and vice versa.

## Requirements

Obviously Starcraft II is needed.

## Installation

Just build in release mode, add the executable to your desired path e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\scres and make sure you add this path to the PATH environment variable.
Then open a cmd prompt and execute scres.
